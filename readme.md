The goal of this project is to analyze the carbon footprint of various industry groups based on Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) data stored in the product_emissions table. The analysis is based on data regarding greenhouse gas emissions attributed to different products and stages of production. These data include companies from different industries and are sourced from publicly available resources.
